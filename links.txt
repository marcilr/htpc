Ceton InfiniTV 6 PCIe does it work with Kodi?
"I'm using an infitiTV 4 PCIe card with WMC and
the ServerWMC addon. It works flawlessly, so I

ServerWMC is a server interface for Windows which communicates
with Windows Media Center (WMC) allowing it to be used as a
Personal Video Recorder (PVR) backend providing Live TV,
PVR functions and Electronic Program Guide (EPG) data.
These services are provided to XBMC though the pvr.wmc add-on.
